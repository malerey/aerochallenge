## Aero Coding Challenge

The server is made with Restler, Node.js and Express.

The frontend is made with React and SASS.

You must download all archives and run the following commands in both the server dir and the client dir:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

The server runs in port 3001 and the frontend in port 3000.

To-dos: 
- SVG icons now the same size but still behave weird on hover.  
- When user clics "Highest price" or "Lowest price" while on page 2, page 1 should be displayed.
- Fake John Kite's identity and claim the 112 (and counting) products on his account.
